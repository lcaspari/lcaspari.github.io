      <p class="motivation">
        Scientific and technological progress has significantly improved human well-being over the past centuries 
        but often at the cost of degrading the natural systems we depend on.
        As we continue to innovate, it is essential that scientific and economic advancements occur within the limits of our planet’s resources. 
        My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and data analysis, and I am now expanding my expertise into Earth system science, 
        particularly through the use of remote sensing technologies to observe and understand environmental processes. 
        I am driven to apply these skills to support a transition toward a future where innovation and decision-making are guided by their environmental impact, 
        ensuring that progress aligns with planetary boundaries.

      <h2>Earth System Data Science & Remote Sensing (M.Sc.)</h2>
      <h3>University of Leipzig</h3>
      <p class="motivation">
        I pursued a student assistant position at the Institute of Geoinformatics at my university towards the end of my bachelor's program.
        The work made me realize that I want to apply my methodological skills to environmental research to support the transition of humanity toward a sustainable economy.
        I was fascinated by remote sensing technologies used in environmental research and the application of technologies to better understand and monitor natural processes.
        In my master’s, I aim to combine data science methods with remote sensing to better understand and respond to the consequences of climate change.

      <h2>Cognitive Science (B.Sc.)</h2>
      <h3>University of Osnabrück</h3>
      <p class="motivation">
        I am fascinated by the capabilities of the human mind. The study program of Cognitive Science aims to unite scientific disciplines
        that investigate the philosophical, scientific, and computational aspects of human cognition.
        I took classes from philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and linguistics to understand different perspectives on cognition.
        The potential of Artificial Intelligence and its real-world applications sparked my focus on data analysis.
        Alongside my studies, I completed internships and assistant roles to explore practical applications of data science.
